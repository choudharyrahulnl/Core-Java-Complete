/**
 * A collection designed for holding elements prior to processing
 * Besides basic Collection operations, queues provide additional insertion, extraction, and inspection operations.
 * Each of these methods exists in two forms: one throws an exception if the operation fails, the other returns a
 * special value (either null or false, depending on the operation).
 * Queues typically, but do not necessarily, order elements in a FIFO (first-in-first-out) manner.
 * In a FIFO queue, all new elements are inserted at the tail of the queue
